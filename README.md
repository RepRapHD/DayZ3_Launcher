Whats The Point?
==============

There will be a rise of mods for the Arma 3 engine. So far there are two, Dead Nation and Zoombies. Each mod seems to have it's own launcher and both lack much needed functionality. Such as setting directory paths and making them stick, launch parameters, etc. This tool works to solve that.
